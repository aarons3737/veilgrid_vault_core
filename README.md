## Veilgrid Vault Core

A web-only, local-first “vault” SDK designed for FlutterFlow-based apps:
- Folder Access API (user-chosen root) with OPFS fallback
- Namespaced per-user storage
- Agent sandboxing + capability tokens
- List/open/save/delete/move/export + backup/restore

### Built by

> Note: This is client-side web code. Do not treat it as a secrecy boundary.
> Security and access control must be enforced by your app’s own auth/permissions model (or use Veilgrid ;) )
